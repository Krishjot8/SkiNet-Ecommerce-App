This is a mock eCommerce project called SkiNet. This application is a single page application with frontEnd and backend functionalities. I created the FrontEnd Using Angular and libraries included are Fontawesome, Bootstrap and RXJS.
I also added lazy loading for the Customer Basket. An NGX Spinner was added when a page loads. Also, Breadcrumbs were used to navigate between nested webpages. Many Other Features were added, such as Stripe payment and Toast Notifications.

For the Backend, I added JWT Authentication for Account login and Registration, added many Controllers alongwith the Repositories. Used Microsoft SQL Server for the database and also Redis for the Customer basket. Paging, Searching, Filtering and Sorted were included in the FrontEnd and
backend. Form Validation was added in the the frontend also.

This a great hands-on eCommerce Application you can try out quickly!! Feel Free to Check it Out!!
